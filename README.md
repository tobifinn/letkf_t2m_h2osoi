# Scripts and TexFile to 'Ensemble-based data assimilation of atmospheric boundary layer observations improves the soil moisture analysis'

This repository contains needed information to the paper
'Ensemble-based data assimilation of atmospheric boundary layer observations improves the soil moisture analysis',
which will be submitted soon to 'Hydrology and Earth System Science'.

Directory structure:
  - experiments: Runscripts for experiments, needed to replicate experiments.
  - notebooks: Jupyter Notebooks to recreate the figures within the paper.
  - scripts: Utility scripts to extract data and for the creation of observations and initial data
  - utility_data: Utility data for the experiments, e.g. constant data of COSMO and CLM
  
  
A environment.yml to replicate the conda environment will be added later.
 
 
Due to the sheer size of the output data for the experiments, all other data is available upon request.
