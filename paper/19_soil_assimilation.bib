  abstract = {Since April 2007, the numerical weather prediction model, COSMO (Consortium for Small Scale Modelling), has been used operationally in a convection-permitting configuration, named COSMO-DE, at the Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD; German weather service). Here the authors discuss the model changes that were necessary for the convective scale, and report on the experience from the first years of operational application of the model. For COSMO-DE the ability of the numerical solver to treat small-scale structures has been improved by using a Runge\textendash Kutta method, which allows for the use of higher-order upwind advection schemes. The one-moment cloud microphysics parameterization has been extended by a graupel class, and adaptations for describing evaporation of rain and stratiform precipitation processes were made. Comparisons with a much more sophisticated two-moment scheme showed only minor differences in most cases with the exception of strong squall-line situations. Whereas the deep convection parameterization was switched off completely, small-scale shallow convection was still parameterized by the appropriate part of the Tiedtke scheme. During the first year of operational use, convective events in synoptically driven situations were satisfactorily simulated. Also the daily cycles of summertime 10-m wind and 1-h precipitation sums were well captured. However, it became evident that the boundary layer description had to be adapted to enhance convection initiation in airmass convection situations. Here the asymptotic Blackadar length scale l{$\infty$} had proven to be a sensitive parameter.},

  abstract = {A Canadian Land Data Assimilation System (CaLDAS) for the analysis of land surface prognostic variables is designed and implemented at the Meteorological Service of Canada for the initialization of numerical weather prediction and climate models. The assimilation of different data sources for the production of daily soil moisture and temperature analyses is investigated in a set of observing system simulation experiments over North America. A simplified variational technique is adapted to accommodate different observation types at their appropriate time in a 24-h time window. The screen-level observations of temperature and relative humidity, from conventional synoptic surface observations (SYNOP)/aviation routine weather report (METAR)/surface aviation observation (SA) reports, are considered together with presently available satellite observations provided by the Aqua satellite (microwave C-band), Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) [infrared (IR)], and observations available in the future by the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite mission (microwave L-band). The aim of these experiments is to assess the information content brought by each observation type in the land surface analysis. The observation systems are simulated according to their spatial coverage, temporal availability, and nominal or expected errors. The results show that the observable with the largest dynamical response to perturbations of the control variable carries the greatest information content into the analysis. The observational error and the observation frequency counterbalance this feature in the analysis. If one considers a single observation both for soil moisture and soil temperature analysis, then satellite measurements (L-band, C-band, and IR in decreasing order of importance) are the primary source of information. When observation availability is considered and the highest temporal frequency of screen-level observations is used (1 h), a large amount of information is extracted from SYNOP-like reports. The screen-level observations are shown to provide valuable soil moisture information mainly during the daytime, while during nighttime these observations (and particularly screen-level temperature) are mostly useful for the soil temperature analysis. The results are presented with perspectives for future operational developments and preliminary assimilation experiments are performed with hourly screen-level observations.},

In the last decade or so, various ways have been developed to combine these methods, especially with the aims of improving the background-error covariance matrices and of improving efficiency. The field has become confusing, even to many specialists, and so there is now a need to summarize the methods in order to show how they work, how they are related, what benefits they bring, why they have been developed, how they perform, and what improvements are pending. This article starts with a reminder of basic variational and ensemble techniques and shows how they can be combined to give the emerging ensemble-variational (EnVar) and hybrid methods. A key part of the article includes details of how localization is commonly represented. There has been a particular push to develop four-dimensional methods that are free of linearized forecast models. This article attempts to provide derivations of the formulations of most popular schemes. These are otherwise scattered throughout the literature or absent. It builds on the nomenclature used to distinguish between methods, and discusses further possible developments to the methods, including the representation of model error.},

  abstract = {The summertime improvement resulting from the operational implementation of a new surface modeling and assimilation strategy into the Canadian regional weather forecasting system is described in this study. The surface processes over land are represented in this system using the Interactions between Soil\textendash Biosphere\textendash Atmosphere (ISBA) land surface scheme. Surface variables, including soil moisture, are initialized using a sequential assimilation technique in which model errors of low-level air temperature and relative humidity are used to determine analysis increments of surface variables. It was found that the magnitude and nature of the analysis increments applied to the surface variables depended on the surface and meteorological conditions observed in each region. In regions characterized by weak meteorological activity (i.e., no clouds or precipitation), model errors of low-level air characteristics are more likely to be related to an incorrect representation of surface processes due to either erroneous initial conditions or inaccurate parameterizations in the land surface scheme. In other regions characterized by more frequent and more intense precipitation events, surface corrections are mainly associated with inaccurate atmospheric forcing. Objective evaluation against observations from radiosondes and surface stations showed that the amplitude of the diurnal cycle of near-surface air temperature and humidity is larger with the new surface system, in better agreement with observations. This type of improvement was found to extend higher up in the boundary layer (up to 700 hPa) where cold and humid biases were significantly reduced by introducing the new surface system. The model precipitation was also found to be significantly influenced by the new representation of surface fluxes. The problematic increase of a positive bias in precipitation with integration time was found to be significantly reduced with the new system, due to the warmer and drier boundary layer.},

  abstract = {This paper discusses the sensitivity of short- and medium-range precipitation forecasts for the central United States to land surface parametrization and soil moisture anomalies. Two forecast systems with different land surface and boundary layer schemes were running in parallel during the extreme rainfall events of July 1993. One forecast system produces much better precipitation forecasts due to a more realistic thermodynamic structure resulting from improved evaporation in an area that is about 1 day upstream from the area of heaviest rain. The paper also discusses two ensembles of 30-day integrations for July 1993. In the first ensemble, soil moisture is initialized at field capacity (100\% availability); in the second ensemble it is at 25\% of soil moisture availability. It is shown that the moist integrations produce a much more realistic precipitation pattern than the dry integrations. These results suggest that there may be some predictive skill in the monthly range related to the time-scale of the soil moisture reservoir. The mechanism responsible for the precipitation differences is concluded to be the result of differences in surface heating in the area 1 day upstream, impacting the atmospheric thermo-dynamic structure. Increased evaporation and reduced heating in moist soil conditions upstream result in the absence of significant boundary layer capping inversion and hence little inhibition of deep precipitating convection.},

Unlike the traditional methods of LSM evaluation or comparison, benchmarking uses a fundamentally different approach in that it sets expectations of performance in a range of metrics a priori\textemdash before model simulations are performed. This can lead to very different conclusions about LSM performance. For this study, both simple physically based models and empirical relationships were used as the benchmarks. Simulations were performed with 13 LSMs using atmospheric forcing for 20 sites, and then model performance relative to these benchmarks was examined. Results show that even for commonly used statistical metrics, the LSMs' performance varies considerably when compared to the different benchmarks. All models outperform the simple physically based benchmarks, but for sensible heat flux the LSMs are themselves outperformed by an out-of-sample linear regression against downward shortwave radiation. While moisture information is clearly central to latent heat flux prediction, the LSMs are still outperformed by a three-variable nonlinear regression that uses instantaneous atmospheric humidity and temperature in addition to downward shortwave radiation. These results highlight the limitations of the prevailing paradigm of LSM evaluation that simply compares an LSM to observations and to other LSMs without a mechanism to objectively quantify the expectations of performance. The authors conclude that their results challenge the conceptual view of energy partitioning at the land surface.},

The diurnal and seasonal variation of surface albedo for this grassland site are discussed. The coupling of precipitation, soil moisture, evaporation, pressure height to the lifting condensation level, and equivalent potential temperature (\texttheta E) on seasonal and diurnal timescales is also discussed. The 1988 data confirm the authors' result, shown earlier from the 1987 data that over moist soils increased evapotranspiration lowers afternoon lifting condensation level and increases afternoon \texttheta E, suggesting a mechanism for a local positive feedback between soil moisture and precipitation on horizontal scales greater than 200 km. The seasonal cycle of ground heat flux and soil temperature is examined and the authors show that the coupling in the warm months between \texttheta E and soil temperature on seasonal scales is similar over land to the coupling found over warm oceans despite very different controls on the surface fluxes. The boundary layer equilibrium over the ocean is contrasted with the diurnal cycle over land, which is soil moisture dependent.},

A long-wave radiative scaling of the diurnal temperature range and the night-time boundary layer is summarized. Several aspects of the local surface energy partition are presented: the role of soilwater availability and clouds; vector methods for understanding mixed layer evolution, and the coupling between surface and boundary layer that determines the lifting condensation level. Moving to larger scales, evaporation-precipitation feedback in models is discussed; and the coupling of column water vapor, clouds and precipitation to vertical motion and moisture convergence over the Amazon.

  abstract = {A suboptimal Kalman filter called the ensemble transform Kalman filter (ET KF) is introduced. Like other Kalman filters, it provides a framework for assimilating observations and also for estimating the effect of observations on forecast error covariance. It differs from other ensemble Kalman filters in that it uses ensemble transformation and a normalization to rapidly obtain the prediction error covariance matrix associated with a particular deployment of observational resources. This rapidity enables it to quickly assess the ability of a large number of future feasible sequences of observational networks to reduce forecast error variance. The ET KF was used by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction in the Winter Storm Reconnaissance missions of 1999 and 2000 to determine where aircraft should deploy dropwindsondes in order to improve 24\textendash 72-h forecasts over the continental United States. The ET KF may be applied to any well-constructed set of ensemble perturbations. The ET KF technique supercedes the ensemble transform (ET) targeting technique of Bishop and Toth. In the ET targeting formulation, the means by which observations reduced forecast error variance was not expressed mathematically. The mathematical representation of this process provided by the ET KF enables such things as the evaluation of the reduction in forecast error variance associated with individual flight tracks and assessments of the value of targeted observations that are distributed over significant time intervals. It also enables a serial targeting methodology whereby one can identify optimal observing sites given the location and error statistics of other observations. This allows the network designer to nonredundantly position targeted observations. Serial targeting can also be used to greatly reduce the computations required to identify optimal target sites. For these theoretical and practical reasons, the ET KF technique is more useful than the ET technique. The methodology is illustrated with observation system simulation experiments involving a barotropic numerical model of tropical cyclonelike vortices. These include preliminary empirical tests of ET KF predictions using ET KF, 3DVAR, and hybrid data assimilation schemes\textemdash the results of which look promising. To concisely describe the future feasible sequences of observations considered in adaptive sampling problems, an extension to Ide et al.'s unified notation for data assimilation is suggested.},

  abstract = {The iterative ensemble Kalman filter (IEnKF) was recently proposed in order to improve the performance of ensemble Kalman filtering with strongly nonlinear geophysical models. The IEnKF can be used as a lag-one smoother and extended to a fixed-lag smoother: the iterative ensemble Kalman smoother (IEnKS). The IEnKS is an ensemble variational method. It does not require the use of the tangent linear of the evolution and observation models, nor the adjoint of these models: the required sensitivities (gradient and Hessian) are obtained from the ensemble. Looking for optimal performance, out of the many possible extensions we consider a quasi-static algorithm. The IEnKS is explored for the Lorenz '95 model and for a two-dimensional turbulence model. As the logical extension of the IEnKF, the IEnKS significantly outperforms standard Kalman filters and smoothers in strongly nonlinear regimes. In mildly nonlinear regimes (typically synoptic-scale meteorology), its filtering performance is marginally but clearly better than the standard ensemble Kalman filter and it keeps improving as the length of the temporal data assimilation window is increased. For long windows, its smoothing performance outranks the standard smoothers very significantly, a result that is believed to stem from the variational but flow-dependent nature of the algorithm. For very long windows, the use of a multiple data assimilation variant of the scheme, where observations are assimilated several times, is advocated. This paves the way for finer reanalysis, freed from the static prior assumption of 4D-Var but also partially freed from the Gaussian assumptions that usually impede standard ensemble Kalman filtering and smoothing.},

  abstract = {Numerical weather prediction models are including an increasing number of components of the Earth system. In particular, every forecast now issued by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) runs with a 3D ocean model and a sea ice model below the atmosphere. Initialisation of different components using different methods and on different timescales can lead to inconsistencies when they are combined in the full system. Historically, the methods for initialising the ocean and the atmosphere have been typically developed separately. This paper describes an approach for combining the existing ocean and atmospheric analyses into what we categorise as a weakly coupled assimilation scheme. Here, we show the performance improvements achieved for the atmosphere by having a weakly coupled ocean\&ndash;atmosphere assimilation system compared with an uncoupled system. Using numerical weather prediction diagnostics, we show that forecast errors are decreased compared with forecasts initialised from an uncoupled analysis. Further, a detailed investigation into spatial coverage of sea ice concentration in the Baltic Sea shows that a much more realistic structure is obtained by the weakly coupled analysis. By introducing the weakly coupled ocean\&ndash;atmosphere analysis, the ocean analysis becomes a critical part of the numerical weather prediction system and provides a platform from which to build ever stronger forms of analysis coupling.},

The analyzed soil moistures are quantitatively compared against a set of in situ sparse soil moisture networks and a set of SMAP core validation sites. These surface analyses are used to initialize a series of 48-h forecasts where near-surface temperature and precipitation are evaluated against in situ observations. Assimilation of SMAP TBs leads to soil moisture that is markedly improved in terms of correlation and standard deviation of the errors (STDE) compared to the use of screen-level observations. NWP forecasts initialized with SMAP-derived soil moistures exhibit a general dry bias in 2-m dewpoint temperatures (TD2m), while displaying a relative warm bias in 2-m temperatures (TT2m), when compared to those forecasts initialized with soil moistures analyzed with screen-level temperature errors. Largest impacts with SMAP are seen for TD2m, where the use of screen-level observations leads to a daytime wet bias that is reduced with SMAP. The overall drier soil moisture leads to improved precipitation bias scores with SMAP. A notable deterioration in TD2m STDE scores was found in the SMAP experiments during the daytime over the Northern Great Plains. A reduction in the daytime TD2m wet bias was found when the observation errors for the screen-level observations were increased.},

CaLDAS is built around an external land surface modeling system and uses the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) methodology. A unique feature of CaLDAS is the use of improved precipitation forcing through the assimilation of precipitation observations. An ensemble of precipitation analyses is generated by combining numerical weather prediction (NWP) model precipitation forecasts with precipitation observations. Spatial phasing errors to the NWP first-guess precipitation forecasts are more effective than perturbations to the precipitation observations in decreasing (increasing) the exceedance ratio (uncertainty ratio) scores and generating flatter, more reliable ranked histograms. CaLDAS has been configured to assimilate L-band microwave brightness temperature TB by coupling the land surface model with a microwave radiative transfer model. A continental-scale synthetic experiment assimilating passive L-band TBs for an entire warm season is performed over North America. Ensemble metric scores are used to quantify the impact of different atmospheric forcing uncertainties on soil moisture and TB ensemble spread. The use of an ensemble of precipitation analyses, generated by assimilating precipitation observations, as forcing combined with the assimilation of L-band TBs gave rise to the largest improvements in superficial soil moisture scores and to a more rapid reduction of the root-zone soil moisture errors. Innovation diagnostics show that the EnKF is able to maintain a sufficient forecast error spread through time, while soil moisture estimation error improvements with increasing ensemble size were limited.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Currently, no extensive, near real time, global soil moisture observation network exists. Therefore, the Met Office global soil moisture analysis scheme has instead used observations of screen temperature and humidity. A number of new space-borne remote sensing systems, operating at microwave frequencies, have been developed that provide a more direct retrieval of surface soil moisture. These systems are attractive since they provide global data coverage and the horizontal resolution is similar to weather forecasting models. Several studies show that measurements of normalised backscatter (surface soil wetness) from the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) on the meteorological operational (MetOp) satellite contain good quality information about surface soil moisture. This study describes methods to convert ASCAT surface soil wetness measurements to volumetric surface soil moisture together with bias correction and quality control. A computationally efficient nudging scheme is used to assimilate the ASCAT volumetric surface soil moisture data into the Met Office global soil moisture analysis. This ASCAT nudging scheme works alongside a soil moisture nudging scheme that uses observations of screen temperature and humidity. Trials, using the Met Office global Unified Model, of the ASCAT nudging scheme show a positive impact on forecasts of screen temperature and humidity for the tropics, North America and Australia. A comparison with in-situ soil moisture measurements from the US also indicates that assimilation of ASCAT surface soil wetness improves the soil moisture analysis. Assimilation of ASCAT surface soil wetness measurements became operational during July 2010.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Maps of this sensitivity index show strong agreement with ``hot spots'' of land-atmosphere coupling and land-driven predictability enhancement found in other studies. The index is found to be robust across data from land surface models driven by observations and free-running global coupled land-atmosphere models, but is compromised in reanalysis data due to inflated interannual variability in soil moisture caused by non-stationarity in the satellite observing system that is used in data assimilation. The index can be calculated from daily observations or model output of sufficient length to ensure statistical significance of results.},

  abstract = {This study compares four model systems in three configurations (LSM, LSM + GCM, and reanalysis) with global flux tower observations to validate states, surface fluxes, and coupling indices between land and atmosphere. Models clearly underrepresent the feedback of surface fluxes on boundary layer properties (the atmospheric leg of land\textendash atmosphere coupling) and may overrepresent the connection between soil moisture and surface fluxes (the terrestrial leg). Models generally underrepresent spatial and temporal variability relative to observations, which is at least partially an artifact of the differences in spatial scale between model grid boxes and flux tower footprints. All models bias high in near-surface humidity and downward shortwave radiation, struggle to represent precipitation accurately, and show serious problems in reproducing surface albedos. These errors create challenges for models to partition surface energy properly, and errors are traceable through the surface energy and water cycles. The spatial distribution of the amplitude and phase of annual cycles (first harmonic) are generally well reproduced, but the biases in means tend to reflect in these amplitudes. Interannual variability is also a challenge for models to reproduce. Although the models validate better against Bowen-ratio-corrected surface flux observations, which allow for closure of surface energy balances at flux tower sites, it is not clear whether the corrected fluxes are more representative of actual fluxes. The analysis illuminates targets for coupled land\textendash atmosphere model development, as well as the value of long-term globally distributed observational monitoring.},

Specifically, Advanced Scatterometer and Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity soil moisture retrievals are assimilated into a system that uses the same model, atmospheric assimilation system, and atmospheric observations as the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2). The atmosphere is sensitive to soil moisture only under certain conditions. Hence, while the globally averaged model improvements were small, regionally, the soil moisture assimilation induced some substantial improvements. For example, in a large region spanning from western Europe across southern Russia, the soil moisture assimilation decreased the RMSE against independent station observations of daily maximum 2-m temperature () by up to 0.4 K, and of 2-m specific humidity (q2m) by up to 0.5 g kg-1. Over all available stations, the mean  RMSE was reduced from 2.82 to 2.79 K, while the mean q2m RMSE was reduced from 1.25 to 1.20 g kg-1. The soil moisture assimilation also reduced the mean RMSE across 29 flux tower sites from 34.2 to 32.6 W m-2 for latent heating, and from 37.7 to 36.5 W m-2 for sensible heating. For all variables evaluated, the soil moisture assimilation improved the model at monthly to seasonal, rather than daily, time scales. Based on the above experiments, it is recommended that satellite soil moisture be assimilated into future reanalyses, including the follow-on to MERRA-2.},

While this generally improves low-level atmospheric forecasts, it often leads to unrealistic model soil moisture. Consequently, several NWP centers are moving toward also assimilating remotely sensed near-surface soil moisture observations. Within this context, an EKF is used to compare the assimilation of screen-level observations and near-surface soil moisture data from AMSR-E into the ISBA land surface model over July 2006. Several issues regarding the use of each data type are exposed, and the potential to use the AMSR-E data, either in place of or together with the screen-level data, is examined. When the two data types are assimilated separately, there is little agreement between the root zone soil moisture updates generated by each, indicating that for this experiment the AMSR-E data could not have replaced the screen-level data to obtain similar surface turbulent fluxes. For the screen-level variables, there is a persistent diurnal cycle in the model-observations bias, which is not related to soil moisture. The resulting diurnal cycle in the analysis increments demonstrates how assimilating screen-level observations can lead to unrealistic soil moisture updates, reinforcing the need to assimilate alternative data sets. However, when the two data types are assimilated together, the near-surface soil moisture provides a much weaker constraint of the root zone soil moisture than the screen-level observations do, and the inclusion of the AMSR-E data does not substantially change the results compared to the assimilation of screen-level variables alone.},

A set of two global 61-day analysis/forecast experiments based on the Integrated Forecast System at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) has been performed for June and July 2002. Analyses and forecasts based on the operational Optimal Interpolation (OI) scheme are compared against results obtained from an open loop system, in which soil moisture evolves freely. It is found that soil moisture assimilation or analysis has a significant impact on the model atmosphere. Temperature forecasts for the Northern Hemisphere up to a level of 700 hPa and up to nine days were significantly improved when the operational analysis was used. A comparison of volumetric soil moisture against in situ observations from the Oklahoma Mesonet reveals, however, that the operational OI system fails to improve both the analysis and the subsequent forecast of soil moisture itself. In addition, the system is not able to correct soil moisture for errors introduced through wrong precipitation in the background forecasts. Biweekly observations from the Illinois Climate Network support these findings. This study confirms the long assumed (but rarely proven) characteristics of analysis schemes using screen-level variables: The observations are efficient in improving the turbulent surface fluxes and consequently the weather forecast on large geographical domains.

  abstract = {Satellite-derived surface soil moisture data sets are readily available and have been used successfully in hydrological applications. In many operational numerical weather prediction systems the initial soil moisture conditions are analyzed from the modeled background and 2 m temperature and relative humidity. This approach has proven its efficiency to improve surface latent and sensible heat fluxes and consequently the forecast on large geographical domains. However, since soil moisture is not always related to screen level variables, model errors and uncertainties in the forcing data can accumulate in root zone soil moisture. Remotely sensed surface soil moisture is directly linked to the model's uppermost soil layer and therefore is a stronger constraint for the soil moisture analysis. For this study, three data assimilation experiments with the Integrated Forecast System (IFS) of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) have been performed for the 2-month period of June and July 2002: a control run based on the operational soil moisture analysis, an open loop run with freely evolving soil moisture, and an experimental run incorporating TMI (TRMM Microwave Imager) derived soil moisture over the southern United States. In this experimental run the satellite-derived soil moisture product is introduced through a nudging scheme using 6-hourly increments. Apart from the soil moisture analysis, the system setup reflects the operational forecast configuration including the atmospheric 4D-Var analysis. Soil moisture analyzed in the nudging experiment is the most accurate estimate when compared against in situ observations from the Oklahoma Mesonet. The corresponding forecast for 2 m temperature and relative humidity is almost as accurate as in the control experiment. Furthermore, it is shown that the soil moisture analysis influences local weather parameters including the planetary boundary layer height and cloud coverage.},

Lewis F. Richardson who attempted numerical weather prediction using hand calculations around the First World War period includes, in his notes, a parameterization of the surface evapotranspiration and plant stomatal control of the vapor exchange between land and atmosphere. He writes: ``\ldots Let the rate of loss of water from a leaf be denoted by T, then here K is the conductance of the stomatal openings and F (\texttheta leaf) is the saturated vapour density at \texttheta.'' [Richardson, 1922]. Almost three-quarters of a century later and using high-speed digital computers, the research community is essentially implementing Lewis F. Richardson's original scheme of stomatal resistance to vapor flux between the saturated interior of leaves at temperature 9ieaf and near-surface air humidity wair. At first sight it may appear that not much scientific progress has been made in the interim years. Transpiration, turbulence and other processes related to land-atmosphere exchange are complex phenomena and in fact there has been significant recent advances in the study of land-atmosphere interaction. The land, biosphere, atmosphere and ocean systems are coupled across a wide range of space and time scales such that each discovery leads to a deeper and larger scientific question. Research inquiry in this area is now performed in both the hydrologic and the atmospheric science communities.},

It is based on forecasting the error statistics using Monte Carlo methods, a better alternative than solving the traditional and computationally extremely demanding approximate error covariance equation used in the extended Kalman filter. The unbounded error growth found in the extended Kalman filter, which is caused by an overly simplified closure in the error covariance equation, is completely eliminated. Open boundaries can be handled as long as the ocean model is well posed. Well-known numerical instabilities associated with the error covariance equation are avoided because storage and evolution of the error covariance matrix itself are not needed. The results are also better than what is provided by the extended Kalman filter since there is no closure problem and the quality of the forecast error statistics therefore improves. The method should be feasible also for more sophisticated primitive equation models. The computational load for reasonable accuracy is only a fraction of what is required for the extended Kalman filter and is given by the storage of, say, 100 model states for an ensemble size of 100 and thus CPU requirements of the order of the cost of 100 model integrations. The proposed method can therefore be used with realistic nonlinear ocean models on large domains on existing computers, and it is also well suited for parallel computers and clusters of workstations where each processor integrates a few members of the ensemble.},

In situ soil moisture observations at 5 cm depth are assimilated into the surface layer and 30 cm deep observations are used to evaluate the root-zone analysis on 12 sites in south-western France (SMOSMANIA network). These sites differ in terms of climate and soil texture. The two methods perform similarly and improve on the open loop. Both methods suffer from incorrect linear assumptions which are particularly degrading to the analysis during water-stressed conditions: the EnSRF by a dry bias and the SEKF by an over-sensitivity of the model Jacobian between the surface and the root-zone layers. These problems are less severe for the sites with wetter climates. A simple bias correction technique is tested on the EnSRF. Although this reduces the bias, it modifies the soil moisture fluxes and suppresses the ensemble spread, which degrades the analysis performance. However, the EnSRF flow-dependent background-error covariance evidently captures seasonal variability in the soil moisture errors and should exploit planned improvements in the model physics. {$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$} Synthetic twin experiments demonstrate that when there is only a random component in the precipitation forcing errors, the correct stochastic representation of these errors enables the EnSRF to perform better than the SEKF.

  abstract = {Abstract. This study evaluates the impact of assimilating surface soil moisture (SSM) and leaf area index (LAI) observations into a land surface model using the SAFRAN\textendash ISBA\textendash MODCOU (SIM) hydrological suite. SIM consists of three stages: (1)~an atmospheric reanalysis (SAFRAN) over France, which forces (2)~the three-layer ISBA land surface model, which then provides drainage and runoff inputs to (3)~the MODCOU hydro-geological model. The drainage and runoff outputs from ISBA are validated by comparing the simulated river discharge from MODCOU with over 500 river-gauge observations over France and with a subset of stations with low-anthropogenic influence, over several years. This study makes use of the A-gs version of ISBA that allows for physiological processes. The atmospheric forcing for the ISBA-A-gs model underestimates direct shortwave and long-wave radiation by approximately 5\hspace{0.166em}\% averaged over France. The ISBA-A-gs model also substantially underestimates the grassland LAI compared with satellite retrievals during winter dormancy. These differences result in an underestimation (overestimation) of evapotranspiration (drainage and runoff). The excess runoff flowing into the rivers and aquifers contributes to an overestimation of the SIM river discharge. Two experiments attempted to resolve these problems: (i)~a correction of the minimum LAI model parameter for grasslands and (ii)~a bias-correction of the model radiative forcing. Two data assimilation experiments were also performed, which are designed to correct random errors in the initial conditions: (iii)~the assimilation of LAI observations and (iv)~the assimilation of SSM and LAI observations. The data assimilation for (iii)~and (iv)~was done with a simplified extended Kalman filter (SEKF), which uses finite differences in the observation operator Jacobians to relate the observations to the model variables. Experiments (i)~and (ii)~improved the median SIM Nash scores by about 9\hspace{0.166em}\% and 18\hspace{0.166em}\% respectively. Experiment (iii)~reduced the LAI phase errors in ISBA-A-gs but had little impact on the discharge Nash efficiency of SIM. In contrast, experiment (iv)~resulted in spurious increases in drainage and runoff, which degraded the median discharge Nash efficiency by about 7\hspace{0.166em}\%. The poor performance of the SEKF originates from the observation operator Jacobians. These Jacobians are dampened when the soil is saturated and when the vegetation is dormant, which leads to positive biases in drainage and/or runoff and to insufficient corrections during winter, respectively. Possible ways to improve the model are discussed, including a new multi-layer diffusion model and a more realistic response of photosynthesis to temperature in mountainous regions. The data assimilation should be advanced by accounting for model and forcing uncertainties.},

SSA is a simplification of the operational land\textendash atmosphere weakly coupled data assimilation (WCDA). The goal of SSA is to provide 1) efficient research into land surface developments in NWP and 2) land reanalyses with land\textendash atmosphere coupling. SSA maintains a coupled forecast model between assimilation cycles, but the atmospheric analysis is not performed; rather, it is forced from an archived analysis. Hence, SSA is much faster than WCDA, although it lacks feedback between the land and atmospheric analyses. A global sensitivity analysis was performed over one year to compare the WCDA and SSA systems. Prescribed proxy 2-m temperature/humidity screen-level observation errors were approximately doubled in the soil moisture data assimilation, thereby reducing the average size of the root-zone soil moisture analysis increments by about 60\%. The systematic impact of these changes on the WCDA surface and near-surface atmospheric dynamics was effectively captured by SSA, although the short-term impact was underestimated. Importantly, the SSA forecast verification scores accurately reflected those of WCDA: atmospheric 1\textendash 10-day temperature/humidity forecasts were degraded in the tropics and lower midlatitudes up to about 700 hPa. The soil moisture analysis performance was not significantly impacted. These results endorse SSA as an NWP research tool and confirm the role of assimilating proxy screen-level observations in the soil moisture analysis to improve weather forecasts. Appropriate use and limitations of SSA are considered.},

This is especially the case in situations where knowledge of flow paths or distributed state variables and/or preservation of physical constraints is important. Examples of this include: spatiotemporal variability of soil moisture, groundwater flow and runoff generation, sediment and contaminant transport, or when feedbacks among various Earth's system processes or understanding the impacts of climate non-stationarity are of primary concern. These are situations where process-based models excel and other models are unverifiable. This article presents this pragmatic view in the context of existing literature to justify the approach where applicable and necessary. We review how improvements in data availability, computational resources and algorithms have made detailed hydrological simulations a reality. Avenues for the future of process-based hydrological models are presented suggesting their use as virtual laboratories, for design purposes, and with a powerful treatment of uncertainty.},

More and more ground-based remote sensing devices for wind profile observations are used to get profiles up to the hub height of wind turbines. However, an observation impact of LiDAR-like wind profile measurements on data assimilation in the atmospheric boundary layer is unknown. We show here the observation impact of boundary layer wind profile measurements on a sub-kilometre-scale data assimilation system for the metropolitan area of Hamburg. This data assimilation system is based on the Kilometre-scale ENsemble Data Assimilation system and the COnsortium for Small-scale MOdelling model. In three stably stratified test cases, we show a positive observation impact of wind profile observations on wind speed in analyses and for forecasts. The analysis improvements in wind speed are propagated to improvements in temperature at forecast time in two of three cases. Additional assimilation of temperature and relative humidity increases the mean absolute increments only by a small amount compared to increments due to wind profile observations. Wind profile observations in the atmospheric boundary layer have therefore valuable information for data assimilation on small scales.},

In some cases, the square root of average ensemble variance is used, and in other cases, the average of ensemble standard deviation is computed instead. The second option is incorrect. To avoid the perpetuation of practices that are not supported by probability theory, the correct equation for computing the average ensemble spread is obtained and the impact of using the wrong equation is illustrated.},

  abstract = {This article focuses on the construction, directly in physical space, of simply parametrized covariance functions for data-assimilation applications. A self-contained, rigorous mathematical summary of relevant topics from correlation theory is provided as a foundation for this construction. Covariance and correlation functions are defined, and common notions of homogeneity and isotropy are clarified. Classical results are stated, and proven where instructive. Included are smoothness properties relevant to multivariate statistical-analysis algorithms where wind/wind and wind/mass correlation models are obtained by differentiating the correlation model of a mass variable. the Convolution Theorem is introduced as the primary tool used to construct classes of covariance and cross-covariance functions on three-dimensional Euclidean space R3. Among these are classes of compactly supported functions that restrict to covariance and cross-covariance functions on the unit sphere S2, and that vanish identically on subsets of positive measure on S2. It is shown that these covariance and cross-covariance functions on S2, referred to as being space-limited, cannot be obtained using truncated spectral expansions. Compactly supported and space-limited covariance functions determine sparse covariance matrices when evaluated on a grid, thereby easing computational burdens in atmospheric data-analysis algorithms. Convolution integrals leading to practical examples of compactly supported covariance and cross-covariance functions on R3 are reduced and evaluated. More specifically, suppose that gi and gj are radially symmetric functions defined on R3 such that gi(x) = 0 for |x| {$>$} di and gj(x) = 0 for |xv {$>$} dj, O {$<$} di,dj {$\leqq$}, where |. | denotes Euclidean distance in R3. the parameters di and dj are `cut-off' distances. Closed-form expressions are determined for classes of convolution cross-covariance functions Cij(x,y) := (gi * gj)(x-y), i {$\neq$} j, and convolution covariance functions Cii(x,y) := (gi * gi)(x-y), vanishing for |x - y| {$>$} di + dj and |x - y| {$>$} 2di, respectively, Additional covariance functions on R3 are constructed using convolutions over the real numbers R, rather than R3. Families of compactly supported approximants to standard second- and third-order autoregressive functions are constructed as illustrative examples. Compactly supported covariance functions of the form C(x,y) := Co(|x - y|), x,y {$\in$} R3, where the functions Co(r) for r {$\in$} R are 5th-order piecewise rational functions, are also constructed. These functions are used to develop space-limited product covariance functions B(x, y) C(x, y), x, y {$\in$} S2, approximating given covariance functions B(x, y) supported on all of S2 \texttimes{} S2.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Continental-scale hyper-resolution simulations constitute a grand challenge in characterizing nonlinear feedbacks of states and fluxes of the coupled water, energy, and biogeochemical cycles of terrestrial systems. Tackling this challenge requires advanced coupling and supercomputing technologies for earth system models that are discussed in this study, utilizing the example of the implementation of the newly developed Terrestrial Systems Modeling Platform (TerrSysMP v1.0) on JUQUEEN (IBM Blue Gene/Q) of the J\"ulich Supercomputing Centre, Germany. The applied coupling strategies rely on the Multiple Program Multiple Data (MPMD) paradigm using the OASIS suite of external couplers, and require memory and load balancing considerations in the exchange of the coupling fields between different component models and the allocation of computational resources, respectively. Using the advanced profiling and tracing tool Scalasca to determine an optimum load balancing leads to a 19\% speedup. In massively parallel supercomputer environments, the coupler OASIS-MCT is recommended, which resolves memory limitations that may be significant in case of very large computational domains and exchange fields as they occur in these specific test cases and in many applications in terrestrial research. However, model I/O and initialization in the petascale range still require major attention, as they constitute true big data challenges in light of future exascale computing resources. Based on a factor-two speedup due to compiler optimizations, a refactored coupling interface using OASIS-MCT and an optimum load balancing, the problem size in a weak scaling study can be increased by a factor of 64 from 512 to 32 768 processes while maintaining parallel efficiencies above 80\% for the component models.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {The prediction of the spatial and temporal variability of land surface states and fluxes with land surface models at high spatial resolution is still a challenge. This study compares simulation results using TerrSysMP including a 3D variably saturated groundwater flow model (ParFlow) coupled to the Community Land Model (CLM) of a 38ha managed grassland head-water catchment in the Eifel (Germany), with soil water content (SWC) measurements from a wireless sensor network, actual evapotranspiration recorded by lysimeters and eddy covariance stations and discharge observations. TerrSysMP was discretized with a 10\texttimes 10m lateral resolution, variable vertical resolution (0.025\textendash 0.575m), and the following parameterization strategies of the subsurface soil hydraulic parameters: (i) completely homogeneous, (ii) homogeneous parameters for different soil horizons, (iii) different parameters for each soil unit and soil horizon and (iv) heterogeneous stochastic realizations. Hydraulic conductivity and Mualem-Van Genuchten parameters in these simulations were sampled from probability density functions, constructed from either (i) soil texture measurements and Rosetta pedotransfer functions (ROS), or (ii) estimated soil hydraulic parameters by 1D inverse modelling using shuffle complex evolution (SCE). The results indicate that the spatial variability of SWC at the scale of a small headwater catchment is dominated by topography and spatially heterogeneous soil hydraulic parameters. The spatial variability of the soil water content thereby increases as a function of heterogeneity of soil hydraulic parameters. For lower levels of complexity, spatial variability of the SWC was underrepresented in particular for the ROS-simulations. Whereas all model simulations were able to reproduce the seasonal evapotranspiration variability, the poor discharge simulations with high model bias are likely related to short-term ET dynamics and the lack of information about bedrock characteristics and an on-site drainage system in the uncalibrated model. In general, simulation performance was better for the SCE setups. The SCE-simulations had a higher inverse air entry parameter resulting in SWC dynamics in better correspondence with data than the ROS simulations during dry periods. This illustrates that small scale measurements of soil hydraulic parameters cannot be transferred to the larger scale and that interpolated 1D inverse parameter estimates result in an acceptable performance for the catchment.},

  abstract = {The land surface controls the partitioning of water and energy fluxes and therefore plays a crucial role in the climate system. The coupling between soil moisture and air temperature, in particular, has been shown to affect the severity and occurrence of temperature extremes and heat waves. Here we study soil moisture-temperature coupling in five land surface models, focusing on the terrestrial segment of the coupling in the warm season. All models are run off-line over a common period with identical atmospheric forcing data, in order to allow differences in the results to be attributed to the models' partitioning of energy and water fluxes. Coupling is calculated according to two semiempirical metrics, and results are compared to observational flux tower data. Results show that the locations of the global hot spots of soil moisture-temperature coupling are similar across all models and for both metrics. In agreement with previous studies, these areas are located in transitional climate regimes. The magnitude and local patterns of model coupling, however, can vary considerably. Model coupling fields are compared to tower data, bearing in mind the limitations in the geographical distribution of flux towers and the differences in representative area of models and in situ data. Nevertheless, model coupling correlates in space with the tower-based results (r = 0.5\textendash 0.7), with the multimodel mean performing similarly to the best-performing model. Intermodel differences are also found in the evaporative fractions and may relate to errors in model parameterizations and ancillary data of soil and vegetation characteristics.,  Soil moisture-temperature coupling in land surface models is highly variable, despite agreement on global coupling hot spotsDifferences in model coupling can be partly attributed to differences in evaporative fractionTower-based results corroborate the location of coupling hot spots and the differences in model performance},

The operational methods include variational methods (3D-Var and 4D-Var), ensemble methods (LETKF) and hybrids between variational and ensemble methods (3DEnVar and 4DEnVar). At several operational centres, other assimilation algorithms, like latent heat nudging, are additionally applied to improve the model initial state, with emphasis on convective scales. It is demonstrated that the quality of forecasts based on initial data from convective-scale DA is significantly better than the quality of forecasts from simple downscaling of larger-scale initial data. However, the duration of positive impact depends on the weather situation, the size of the computational domain and the data that are assimilated. Furthermore it is shown that more advanced methods applied at convective scales provide improvements over simpler methods. This motivates continued research and development in convective-scale DA. Challenges in research and development for improvements of convective-scale DA are also reviewed and discussed. The difficulty of handling the wide range of spatial and temporal scales makes development of multi-scale assimilation methods and space\textendash time covariance localization techniques important. Improved utilization of observations is also important. In order to extract more information from existing observing systems of convective-scale phenomena (e.g. weather radar data and satellite image data), it is necessary to provide improved statistical descriptions of the observation errors associated with these observations.},

  abstract = {This paper reviews the development of the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) for atmospheric data assimilation. Particular attention is devoted to recent advances and current challenges. The distinguishing properties of three well-established variations of the EnKF algorithm are first discussed. Given the limited size of the ensemble and the unavoidable existence of errors whose origin is unknown (i.e., system error), various approaches to localizing the impact of observations and to accounting for these errors have been proposed. However, challenges remain; for example, with regard to localization of multiscale phenomena (both in time and space). For the EnKF in general, but higher-resolution applications in particular, it is desirable to use a short assimilation window. This motivates a focus on approaches for maintaining balance during the EnKF update. Also discussed are limited-area EnKF systems, in particular with regard to the assimilation of radar data and applications to tracking severe storms and tropical cyclones. It seems that relatively less attention has been paid to optimizing EnKF assimilation of satellite radiance observations, the growing volume of which has been instrumental in improving global weather predictions. There is also a tendency at various centers to investigate and implement hybrid systems that take advantage of both the ensemble and the variational data assimilation approaches; this poses additional challenges and it is not clear how it will evolve. It is concluded that, despite more than 10 years of operational experience, there are still many unresolved issues that could benefit from further research.Contents Introduction...4490Popular flavors of the EnKF algorithm...4491 General description...4491Stochastic and deterministic filters...4492 The stochastic filter...4492The deterministic filter...4492Sequential or local filters...4493 Sequential ensemble Kalman filters...4493The local ensemble transform Kalman filter...4494Extended state vector...4494Issues for the development of algorithms...4495Use of small ensembles...4495 Monte Carlo methods...4495Validation of reliability...4497Use of group filters with no inbreeding...4498Sampling error due to limited ensemble size: The rank problem...4498Covariance localization...4499 Localization in the sequential filter...4499Localization in the LETKF...4499Issues with localization...4500Summary...4501Methods to increase ensemble spread...4501 Covariance inflation...4501 Additive inflation...4501Multiplicative inflation...4502Relaxation to prior ensemble information...4502Issues with inflation...4503Diffusion and truncation...4503Error in physical parameterizations...4504 Physical tendency perturbations...4504Multimodel, multiphysics, and multiparameter approaches...4505Future directions...4505Realism of error sources...4506Balance and length of the assimilation window...4506 The need for balancing methods...4506Time-filtering methods...4506Toward shorter assimilation windows...4507Reduction of sources of imbalance...4507Regional data assimilation...4508 Boundary conditions and consistency across multiple domains...4509Initialization of the starting ensemble...4510Preprocessing steps for radar observations...4510Use of radar observations for convective-scale analyses...4511Use of radar observations for tropical cyclone analyses...4511Other issues with respect to LAM data assimilation...4511The assimilation of satellite observations...4512 Covariance localization...4512Data density...4513Bias-correction procedures...4513Impact of covariance cycling...4514Assumptions regarding observational error...4514Recommendations regarding satellite observations...4515Computational aspects...4515 Parameters with an impact on quality...4515Overview of current parallel algorithms...4516Evolution of computer architecture...4516Practical issues...4517Approaching the gray zone...4518Summary...4518Hybrids with variational and EnKF components...4519 Hybrid background error covariances...4519E4DVar with the {$\alpha$} control variable...4519Not using linearized models with 4DEnVar...4520The hybrid gain algorithm...4521Open issues and recommendations...4521Summary and discussion...4521 Stochastic or deterministic filters...4522The nature of system error...4522Going beyond the synoptic scales...4522Satellite observations...4523Hybrid systems...4523Future of the EnKF...4523APPENDIX A...4524Types of Filter Divergence...4524 Classical filter divergence...4524Catastrophic filter divergence...4524APPENDIX B...4524Systems Available for Download...4524References...4525},

  abstract = {Data assimilation is an iterative approach to the problem of estimating the state of a dynamical system using both current and past observations of the system together with a model for the system's time evolution. Rather than solving the problem from scratch each time new observations become available, one uses the model to ``forecast'' the current state, using a prior state estimate (which incorporates information from past data) as the initial condition, then uses current data to correct the prior forecast to a current state estimate. This Bayesian approach is most effective when the uncertainty in both the observations and in the state estimate, as it evolves over time, are accurately quantified. In this article, we describe a practical method for data assimilation in large, spatiotemporally chaotic systems. The method is a type of ``ensemble Kalman filter'', in which the state estimate and its approximate uncertainty are represented at any given time by an ensemble of system states. We discuss both the mathematical basis of this approach and its implementation; our primary emphasis is on ease of use and computational speed rather than improving accuracy over previously published approaches to ensemble Kalman filtering. We include some numerical results demonstrating the efficiency and accuracy of our implementation for assimilating real atmospheric data with the global forecast model used by the US National Weather Service.},

  abstract = {Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) may have a longer spin-up time to reach its asymptotic level of accuracy than the corresponding spin-up time in variational methods (3D-Var or 4D-Var). During the spin-up EnKF has to fulfill two independent requirements, namely that the ensemble mean be close to the true state, and that the ensemble perturbations represent the `errors of the day'. As a result, there are cases, such as radar observations of a severe storm, or regional forecast of a hurricane, where EnKF may spin-up too slowly to be useful. A heuristic scheme is proposed to accelerate the spin-up of EnKF by applying a no-cost Ensemble Kalman Smoother, and using the observations more than once in each assimilation window during spin-up in order to maximize the initial extraction of information. The performance of this scheme is tested with the Local Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter (LETKF) implemented in a quasi-geostrophic model, which requires a very long spin-up time when initialized from random initial perturbations from a uniform distribution. Results show that with the new `running in place' (RIP) scheme the LETKF spins up and converges to the optimal level of error faster than 3D-Var or 4D-Var, even in the absence of any prior information. Additional computations (2 to 12 iterations for each assimilation window) are only required during the initial spin-up, since the scheme naturally returns to the original LETKF after spin-up is achieved. RIP also accelerates spin-up when the initial perturbations are drawn from a well-tuned 3D-Var background-error covariance, rather than being uniform noise, and fewer iterations and RIP cycles are required than in the case without such prior information.

The land surface models (LSMs) of NWPs are often employed in hydrological applications, which raises the question of how hydrologically representative LSMs really are. In this paper, precipitation (P), evaporation (E), and runoff (R) from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts global models were evaluated against observational products. The forecasts differ substantially from observed data for key hydrological variables. In addition, imbalanced surface water budgets, mostly caused by data assimilation, were found on both global (P-E) and basin scales (P-E-R), with the latter being more important. Modeled surface fluxes should be used with care in hydrological applications, and further improvement in LSMs in terms of process descriptions, resolution, and estimation of uncertainties is needed to accurately describe the land surface water budgets.},

  abstract = {The hydrologic cycle results from the combination of energy conversions and atmospheric transport, and the laws of thermodynamics set limits to both. Here, we apply thermodynamics to derive the limits of the strength of hydrologic cycling within the Earth system and about the properties and processes that shape these limits. We set up simple models to derive analytical expressions of the limits of evaporation and precipitation in relation to vertical and horizontal differences in solar radiative forcing. These limits result from a fundamental trade-off by which a greater evaporation rate reduces the temperature gradient and thus the driver for atmospheric motion that exchanges moistened air from the surface with the drier air aloft. The limits on hydrologic cycling thus reflect the strong interaction between the hydrologic flux, motion, and the driving gradient. Despite the simplicity of the models, they yield estimates for the limits of hydrologic cycling that are within the observed magnitude, suggesting that the global hydrologic cycle operates near its maximum strength. We close with a discussion of how thermodynamic limits can provide a better characterization of the interaction of vegetation and human activity with hydrologic cycling.},

Up to now, forecast products focus on atmospheric variables, such as precipitation, air temperature and, in hydrology, on river discharge. Considering the full terrestrial system from groundwater across the land surface into the atmosphere, a number of important hydrologic variables are missing especially with regard to the shallow and deeper subsurface (e.g., groundwater), which are gaining considerable attention in the context of global change. In this study, we propose a terrestrial monitoring/forecasting system using the Terrestrial Systems Modeling Platform (TSMP) that predicts all essential states and fluxes of the terrestrial hydrologic and energy cycles from groundwater into the atmosphere. Closure of the terrestrial cycles provides a physically consistent picture of the terrestrial system in TSMP. TSMP has been implemented over a regional domain over North Rhine-Westphalia and a continental domain over Europe in a real-time forecast/monitoring workflow. Applying a real-time forecasting/monitoring workflow over both domains, experimental forecasts are being produced with different lead times since the beginning of 2016. Real-time forecast/monitoring products encompass all compartments of the terrestrial system including additional hydrologic variables, such as plant available soil water, groundwater table depth, and groundwater recharge and storage.},

The 12 AGCM groups participating in GLACE performed a series of simple numerical experiments that allow the objective quantification of this element for boreal summer. The derived coupling strengths vary widely. Some similarity, however, is found in the spatial patterns generated by the models, with enough similarity to pinpoint multimodel ``hot spots'' of land\textendash atmosphere coupling. For boreal summer, such hot spots for precipitation and temperature are found over large regions of Africa, central North America, and India; a hot spot for temperature is also found over eastern China. The design of the GLACE simulations are described in full detail so that any interested modeling group can repeat them easily and thereby place their model's coupling strength within the broad range of those documented here.},

The system assimilates a wide variety of ocean and atmospheric observations and produces ocean\textendash atmosphere analyses with a coupled model. Employing the coupled-model constraint in the analysis implies that assimilation of an ocean observation has immediate impact on the atmospheric state estimate and, conversely, assimilation of an atmospheric observation affects the ocean state. This covariance between atmosphere and ocean induced by the analysis method is illustrated with simple numerical experiments. Realistic data assimilation experiments based on the global observing system are then used to assess the quality of the assimilation method. Comparison with an uncoupled system shows a mostly neutral impact overall, with slightly improved temperature estimates in the upper ocean and lower atmosphere. These preliminary results are considered of interest for the ongoing community efforts focusing on coupled data assimilations.},

The first product consists of multi-angle, dual-polarization brightness temperature (Tb) observations at the bottom of the atmosphere extracted from Level 1 data. The second product is a derived SMOS Tb product that mimics the data at a 40\textdegree{} incidence angle from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission. The third product is the operational SMOS Level 2 surface soil moisture (SM) retrieval product. The assimilation system uses a spatially distributed ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) with seasonally varying climatological bias mitigation for Tb assimilation, whereas a time-invariant cumulative density function matching is used for SM retrieval assimilation. All assimilation experiments improve the soil moisture estimates compared to model-only simulations in terms of unbiased root-mean-square differences and anomaly correlations during the period from 1 July 2010 to 1 May 2015 and for 187 sites across the US. Especially in areas where the satellite data are most sensitive to surface soil moisture, large skill improvements (e.g., an increase in the anomaly correlation by 0.1) are found in the surface soil moisture. The domain-average surface and root-zone skill metrics are similar among the various assimilation experiments, but large differences in skill are found locally. The observation-minus-forecast residuals and analysis increments reveal large differences in how the observations add value in the Tb and SM retrieval assimilation systems. The distinct patterns of these diagnostics in the two systems reflect observation and model errors patterns that are not well captured in the assigned EnKF error parameters. Consequently, a localized optimization of the EnKF error parameters is needed to further improve Tb or SM retrieval assimilation.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Recently a number of studies have found significant differences between Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface mapping and the land surface parameters of the Community Land Model (CLM) of the Community Climate System Model (CCSM). To address these differences in land surface description, we have developed new CLM 3.0 land surface parameters that reproduce the physical properties described in the MODIS land surface data while maintaining the multiple Plant Functional Type (PFT) canopy and herbaceous layer representation used in CLM. These new parameters prescribe crop distributions directly from historical crop mapping allowing cropping to be described in CLM for any year from 1700 to current day. The new model parameters are calculated at 0.05 degrees resolution so they can be aggregated and used over a wider range of model grid resolutions globally. Compared to the current CLM 3.0 parameters, the new parameters have an increase in bare soil fraction of 10\% which is realized through reduced tree, shrub, and crop cover. The new parameters also have area average increases of 10\% for leaf area index (LAI) and stem area index (SAI) values, with the largest increases in tropical forests. The new land surface parameters have strong repeatable impacts on the climate simulated in CCSM 3.0 with large improvements in surface albedo compared to MODIS values. In many cases the improvements in surface albedo directly resulted in improved simulation of precipitation and near-surface air temperature; however, for the most part the existing biases of CCSM 3.0 remained with the new parameters. Further analysis of changes in surface hydrology revealed that the increased LAI of the new parameters resulted in lower overall evapotranspiration with reduced precipitation in CCSM 3.0. This was an unexpected result given that other research into the impacts of vegetation change suggests that the new parameters should have the opposite impact. This suggests that while the new parameters significantly improve the climate simulated in CLM 3.0 and CCSM 3.0, the new surface parameters have limited success in rectifying surface hydrology biases that result from the parameterizations within the CLM 3.0.},

The implementation here is based on a ``weakly'' coupled data assimilation approach whereby the coupled model is used to provide background information for separate ocean\textendash sea ice and atmosphere\textendash land analyses. The increments generated from these separate analyses are then added back into the coupled model. This is different from the existing Met Office system for initializing coupled forecasts, which uses ocean and atmosphere analyses that have been generated independently using the FOAM ocean data assimilation system and NWP atmosphere assimilation systems, respectively. A set of trials has been run to investigate the impact of the weakly coupled data assimilation on the analysis, and on the coupled forecast skill out to 5\textendash 10 days. The analyses and forecasts have been assessed by comparing them to observations and by examining differences in the model fields. Encouragingly for this new system, both ocean and atmospheric assessments show the analyses and coupled forecasts produced using coupled DA to be very similar to those produced using separate ocean\textendash atmosphere data assimilation. This work has the benefit of highlighting some aspects on which to focus to improve the coupled DA results. In particular, improving the modeling and data assimilation of the diurnal SST variation and the river runoff should be examined.},

The study uses the Noah land surface model coupled with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model and the National Meteorological Center (NMC) method for computing the land\textendash atmosphere background error covariance from 2015 to 2017 over the contiguous United States. The results show that the forecast errors in top-10-cm soil moisture and near-surface air potential temperature and specific humidity are correlated and relatively large during the daytime in the summer. The magnitude of the error correlation between these three states is comparable. For example, in July, the error correlation averaged over all day- and nighttime samples is -0.13 for near-surface temperature and humidity, -0.20 for surface soil moisture and near-surface temperature, and 0.15 for surface soil moisture and near-surface humidity. During the summer, the forecast errors in surface soil moisture are correlated with those of atmospheric states up to the sigma pressure level of 0.9 (approximately 900 hPa for a sea level location) with domain-mean correlations of -0.15 and 0.1 for temperature and humidity, respectively. The results suggest that assimilation of satellite soil moisture data could provide cross-variable impacts comparable to those assimilating conventional near-surface temperature and humidity data.

In contrast, strongly coupled data assimilation (SCDA) allows simultaneous correction of atmospheric and land surface states but has not been sufficiently explored with land surface soil moisture data assimilation. This study implemented a variational approach to assimilate the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) 9-km enhanced retrievals into the Noah land surface model coupled with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model under a framework of both WCDA and SCDA. The goal of the study is to quantify the relative impact of assimilating SMAP data under different coupling frameworks on the atmospheric forecasts in the summer. The results of the numerical experiments during July 2016 show that SCDA can provide additional benefits on the forecasts of air temperature and humidity compared to WCDA. Over the U.S. Great Plains, assimilation of SMAP data under WCDA reduces a warm bias in temperature and a dry bias in humidity by 7.3\% and 19.3\%, respectively, while the SCDA case contributes an additional bias reduction of 2.2\% (temperature) and 3.3\% (humidity). While WCDA leads to a reduction of RMSE in temperature forecasts by 4.1\%, SCDA results in additional reduction of RMSE by 0.8\%. For the humidity, the reduction of RMSE is around 1\% for both WCDA and SCDA.},

  abstract = {The relationship between soil moisture (SM) and temperature at 2-m height (T2) is examined with long-term meteorological and soil observations and a single-column model. With the information flow (IF) and correlation analysis methods, results show that the distribution of SM depends on land use and land cover, while an increase in vegetation fraction corresponds to an increase in SM, and this dependence decreases with soil depth. There is causality between T2 and SM at all soil levels. Compared with those in deeper soil, higher IF values and correlations appear in the top soil levels, implying a stronger interaction between the top soil layer and the atmosphere. Meanwhile, most correlation coefficient values rank weak or moderate, and negative feedback is predominant with low IF values, indicating that the causality between them is relatively weak and also proving that SM is not the sole factor that influences changes of near-surface temperature. The single-column model demonstrates that an increase (decrease) in SM will result in cooler (warmer) T2 through the redistribution of surface heat flux, while changes in SM in the top soil layers have a stronger influence on T2 compared to those in deep soil layers. The duration of the atmospheric temperature inversion layer is also prolonged (reduced) with an increase (decrease) in SM. Impacts of SM on T2 vary with land use or vegetation fraction and also are more significant in warm months and the daytime than in cold months and nighttime. Moreover, large-scale and local circulations have steady influences on T2 in different weather conditions.},

  abstract = {The main purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that it is possible to estimate soil moisture from the evolution of atmospheric parameters near the surface (temperature and relative humidity) if a realistic surface transfer model is available. Two methods to initialize soil moisture in meteorological models are then proposed: a variational method where the optimal soil moisture minimizes a penality function and a sequential method consisting of a set of predictions and static corrections of soil moisture. The algorithms are examined with a one-dimensional model including a detailed land-surface parameterization. A feasibility study is undertaken using the HAPEX-MOBILHY dataset where soil moisture has been measured together with atmospheric parameters. It is demonstrated that for three 48-h clear-sky periods the two methods are able to converge rapidly toward a realistic soil moisture content starting from arbitrary values.},

  abstract = {Two analysis schemes are developed within an off-line version of the land surface scheme ISBA for the initialization of soil water content and temperature in numerical weather prediction models. The first soil analysis is based on optimal interpolation that is currently operational in a number of weather centers. The second soil analysis is an extended Kalman filter (EKF) which will allow the assimilation of satellite observations. First, it is shown, by comparing the Kalman gain of both analysis schemes, that it is possible to assimilate screen level temperature and relative humidity in an off-line system. This is of great interest for future combined assimilations of conventional and satellite data. The reduced computing time in running the land surface scheme outside the atmospheric model makes Kalman filter approaches compatible with operational requirements. The methodology for coupling the land surface data assimilation with the atmospheric analysis system is explained in order to highlight the existing feedbacks between the two systems (in comparison to fully decoupled land data assimilation systems). The linearity of the observation operator Jacobians estimated by finite differences and the relevance of the soil prognostic variables to be initialized are assessed. Finally, the two systems are compared over western Europe for the month of July 2006 by assimilating screen level temperature and relative humidity every 6 h. The EKF has been simplified by keeping the covariance matrix of background errors constant. The two soil analysis schemes behave similarly in response to screen level atmospheric errors. The EKF is superior in identifying situations where the near-surface atmosphere is sensitive to soil perturbations, which leads to better use of observations. Over France, the capability of both systems to moisten the soil when rain events are absent from the forcing is demonstrated.},

Examination of the dependence of the nocturnal boundary layer on stability suggests three regimes: a) the weakly stable case, b) a transition stability regime where many of the variables change rapidly with increasing stability and c) the very stable case. The value of z/L where the downward heat flux is a maximum defines the stability boundary between the weakly stable and transition regimes, where L is the Obukhov length. In the present analysis, the downward heat flux reaches a maximum at z/L approximately equal to 0.05 for 10 m, although comparison with other data indicates that this is not a universal value. For weaker stability, the heat flux decreases with decreasing z/L due to weaker temperature fluctuations. In the transition stability regime, the heat flux decreases rapidly with increasing stability due to restriction of vertical velocity fluctuations by the increasing stratification.},

The main outputs of the operational data assimilation systems, the increments, have been compared for February 2014 in various regions. The eddy-permitting systems' increments are similar in a number of the regions, indicating similar forecast errors are being corrected, while the eddy-resolving systems represent smaller-scale structures in the mid-latitude regions investigated and appear to have smaller biases. Monthly average temperature increments show significant SST biases, particularly in the systems which assimilate swath satellite SST data, indicating systematic errors in the surface heat fluxes and the way in which they are propagated vertically by the ocean models. On-going developments to the data assimilation systems include improvements to the specification of error covariances, improving assimilation of data near the equator, and understanding the effect of assimilation on the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. Longer term developments are expected to include the implementation of more advanced algorithms to make use of flow-dependent error covariance information. Assimilation of new data sources over the coming years, such as wide-swath altimetry, is also expected to improve the accuracy of ocean state estimates and forecasts provided by the GODAE OceanView systems.},

This system, referred to as the High Resolution Deterministic Prediction System (HRDPS), is currently downscaled from MSC's operational 10-km GEM-based regional system but uses initial surface fields from a high-resolution (2.5 km) land data assimilation system coupled to the HRDPS and initial hydrometeor fields from the forecast of a 2.5-km cycle, which reduces the spinup time for clouds and precipitation. Forecast runs of 48 h are provided four times daily. The HRDPS was tested and compared to the operational 10-km system. Model runs from the two systems were evaluated against surface observations for common weather elements (temperature, humidity, winds, and precipitation), fractional cloud cover, and also against upper-air soundings, all using standard metrics. Although the predictions of some fields were degraded in some specific regions, the HRDPS generally outperformed the operational system for a majority of the scores. The evaluation illustrates the added value of the 2.5-km model and the potential for improved numerical guidance for the prediction of high-impact weather.},

The computational challenge includes the eigenvalue decomposition of 10,240 \texttimes{} 10,240 dense covariance matrices at each grid point.

The flow-dependent 10,240-member ensemble revealed meaningful long-range error correlations at continental scales. The surface pressure error correlation shows teleconnection patterns like the Pacific North American pattern. Specific humidity error correlation shows continental scale wave trains. Investigations with different ensemble sizes suggest that at least several hundred members be necessary to capture these continental scale error correlations.},

In this paper, the impact of assimilating SMOS TB alone or in combination with screen-level observations and Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) soil moisture retrievals is assessed. Independent quality controlled insitu soil moisture observations belonging to several networks included in the International Soil Moisture Network, were used to validate the quality of both the new soil moisture analyses and the skill to predict soil moisture up to 5 days ahead. The impact on atmospheric variables is indirect and was evaluated through computation of the forecast skill at different lead times. The analysis period was selected to be around the boreal summer, a period of the year when evaporatranspiration fluxes are stronger, and when it is therefore expected that the assimilation of remote-sensing data provides the largest impact on the state of the soil. The results show that the soil moisture state benefits from the direct assimilation of SMOS TB, especially in better representing the temporal variations of soil moisture. The skill of atmospheric variables is mainly driven by the screen-level observations. Despite the clear benefits to the soil state, remote-sensing data need to be used with screen-level variables to add value to the state of the atmosphere, pointing to inconsistencies in the physical coupling between the land and near-surface components of the ECMWF Earth system.},

  abstract = {The Community Land Model version 3 (CLM3) is the land component of the Community Climate System Model (CCSM). CLM3 has energy and water biases resulting from deficiencies in some of its canopy and soil parameterizations related to hydrological processes. Recent research by the community that utilizes CLM3 and the family of CCSM models has indicated several promising approaches to alleviating these biases. This paper describes the implementation of a selected set of these parameterizations and their effects on the simulated hydrological cycle. The modifications consist of surface data sets based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer products, new parameterizations for canopy integration, canopy interception, frozen soil, soil water availability, and soil evaporation, a TOPMODEL-based model for surface and subsurface runoff, a groundwater model for determining water table depth, and the introduction of a factor to simulate nitrogen limitation on plant productivity. The results from a set of offline simulations were compared with observed data for runoff, river discharge, soil moisture, and total water storage to assess the performance of the new model (referred to as CLM3.5). CLM3.5 exhibits significant improvements in its partitioning of global evapotranspiration (ET) which result in wetter soils, less plant water stress, increased transpiration and photosynthesis, and an improved annual cycle of total water storage. Phase and amplitude of the runoff annual cycle is generally improved. Dramatic improvements in vegetation biogeography result when CLM3.5 is coupled to a dynamic global vegetation model. Lower than observed soil moisture variability in the rooting zone is noted as a remaining deficiency.},

CPMs no longer rely on convection parameterization schemes, which had been identified as a major source of errors and uncertainties in LSMs. Moreover, CPMs allow for a more accurate representation of surface and orography fields. The drawback of CPMs is the high demand on computational resources. For this reason, first CPM climate simulations only appeared a decade ago. In this study, we aim to provide a common basis for CPM climate simulations by giving a holistic review of the topic. The most important components in CPMs such as physical parameterizations and dynamical formulations are discussed critically. An overview of weaknesses and an outlook on required future developments is provided. Most importantly, this review presents the consolidated outcome of studies that addressed the added value of CPM climate simulations compared to LSMs. Improvements are evident mostly for climate statistics related to deep convection, mountainous regions, or extreme events. The climate change signals of CPM simulations suggest an increase in flash floods, changes in hail storm characteristics, and reductions in the snowpack over mountains. In conclusion, CPMs are a very promising tool for future climate research. However, coordinated modeling programs are crucially needed to advance parameterizations of unresolved physics and to assess the full potential of CPMs.},

  abstract = {The importance of horizontal error correlations in background (i.e., model forecast) fields for large-scale soil moisture estimation is assessed by comparing the performance of one- and three-dimensional ensemble Kalman filters (EnKF) in a twin experiment. Over a domain centered on the U. S. Great Plains, gauge-based precipitation data is used to force the ``true'' model solution, and reanalysis data for the prior (or background) fields. The difference between the two precipitation datasets is thought to be representative of errors that might be encountered in a global land assimilation system. To ensure realistic conditions the synthetic observations of surface soil moisture match the spatiotemporal pattern and expected errors of retrievals from the Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) on the Nimbus-7 satellite. After filter calibration, average actual estimation errors in the (volumetric) root zone moisture content are 0.015 m3 m-3 for the 3D-EnKF, 0.019 m3 m-3 for the 1D-EnKF, and 0.036 m3 m-3 without assimilation. Clearly, taking horizontal error correlations into account improves estimation accuracy. Soil moisture estimation errors in the 3D-EnKF are smallest for a correlation scale of 2\textdegree{} in model parameter and forcing errors, which coincides with the horizontal scale of difference fields between gauge-based and reanalysis precipitation. In this case the 3D-EnKF requires 1.6 times the computational effort of the 1D-EnKF, but this factor depends on the experiment setup.},

In this research LST retrievals from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) are assimilated into the Noah land surface model and Catchment land surface model (CLSM) using an ensemble-based, offline land data assimilation system. LST is described very differently in the two models. A priori scaling and dynamic bias estimation approaches are applied because satellite and model LSTs typically exhibit different mean values and variabilities. Performance is measured against 27 months of in situ measurements from the Coordinated Energy and Water Cycle Observations Project at 48 stations. LST estimates from Noah and CLSM without data assimilation (``open loop'') are comparable to each other and superior to ISCCP retrievals. For LST, the RMSE values are 4.9 K (CLSM), 5.5 K (Noah), and 7.6 K (ISCCP), and the anomaly correlation coefficients (R) are 0.61 (CLSM), 0.63 (Noah), and 0.52 (ISCCP). Assimilation of ISCCP retrievals provides modest yet statistically significant improvements (over an open loop, as indicated by nonoverlapping 95\% confidence intervals) of up to 0.7 K in RMSE and 0.05 in the anomaly R. The skill of the latent and sensible heat flux estimates from the assimilation integrations is essentially identical to the corresponding open loop skill. Noah assimilation estimates of ground heat flux, however, can be significantly worse than open loop estimates. Provided the assimilation system is properly adapted to each land model, the benefits from the assimilation of LST retrievals are comparable for both models.},

We evaluated the AWRA-L SM estimates with and without assimilation against in situ moisture measurements in southeast Australia (OzNet), as well as against a new network of cosmic-ray moisture probes (CosmOz) spread across the country. Results show that AWRA-L root-zone moisture estimates are improved though the assimilation of satellite SM: model estimates of 0\textendash 30cm moisture content improved for more than 90\% of OzNet sites, with an increase in average correlation from 0.68 (before assimilation) to 0.73 (after assimilation); while estimates 0\textendash 90cm moisture improved for 60\% of sites with increased average correlation from 0.56 to 0.65. The assimilation of AMSR-E and ASCAT appeared to yield similar performance gains for the top-layer, however ASCAT data assimilation improved root-zone estimation for more sites. Poor performance of one data set was compensated by the other through joint assimilation. The most significant improvements in AWRA-L root-zone moisture estimation (with increases in correlation as high as 90\%) occurred for siteswhere both the assimilation of satellite soil moisture improved top-layer SM accuracy and the open-loop deep-layer storage estimates were reasonably good. CosmOz SM measurements exhibited highest correlation with AWRA-L estimates for modelled root-zones layer thicknesses ranging from 20cm to 1m. Slight improvements through satellite data assimilation were observed for only 2 of 7 CosmOz sites, but the comparison was affected by a short data overlap period. The location of some of the CosmOz probes was not optimal for evaluation of satellite SM assimilation, but their utility is demonstrated and the observations may become suitable for assimilation themselves in future.},

  abstract = {A new land surface analysis system based on a simplified point-wise Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) was implemented at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts in the global operational Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) in November 2010. This system will allow consistent and optimal analyses of land surface parameters like soil moisture, surface temperatures, snow and vegetation properties. As part of the system implementation, the surface analysis structure has been revised to permit an independent and parallel computation with the upper-air 4D-Var analysis. The new analysis system is used for the soil moisture analysis, replacing the previous Optimal Interpolation (OI) scheme. Similar to the OI system, the simplified EKF uses 2 m air temperature and relative humidity observations from the SYNOP (land surface synoptic report) ground-based networks to analyse soil moisture. This paper describes the new land surface analysis, its application for analysing soil moisture, and initial verification results which supported its operational implementation at ECMWF. The performance is evaluated based on a set of one-year analysis experiments. The simplified EKF is compared to the OI, on soil moisture, 2 m temperature and relative humidity, showing a consistent improvement on screen-level parameters and soil moisture forecasts. To demonstrate the potential of the new analysis scheme, soil moisture derived from ASCAT (Advanced Scatterometer) has been assimilated through the simplified EKF.},

In the first part, a scheme is introduced that is similar to the ensemble randomized maximal likelihood (EnRML) filter by Gu and Oliver. The two new elements in the scheme are the use of the ensemble square root filter instead of the traditional (perturbed observations) EnKF and rescaling of the ensemble anomalies with the ensemble transform matrix from the previous iteration instead of estimating sensitivities between the ensemble observations and ensemble anomalies at the start of the assimilation cycle by linear regression. A simple modification turns the scheme into an ensemble formulation of the iterative extended Kalman filter. The two versions of the algorithm are referred to as the iterative EnKF (IEnKF) and the iterative extended Kalman filter (IEKF).{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}In the second part, the performance of the IEnKF and IEKF is tested in five numerical experiments: two with the 3-element Lorenz model and three with the 40-element Lorenz model. Both the IEnKF and IEKF show a considerable advantage over the EnKF in strongly nonlinear systems when the quality or density of observations are sufficient to constrain the model to the regime of mainly linear propagation of the ensemble anomalies as well as constraining the fast-growing modes, with a much smaller advantage otherwise.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}The IEnKF and IEKF can potentially be used with large-scale models, and can represent a robust and scalable alternative to particle filter (PF) and hybrid PF\textendash EnKF schemes in strongly nonlinear systems.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {The role of soil moisture in NWP has gained more attention in recent years, as studies have demonstrated impacts of land surface states on ambient weather from diurnal to seasonal scales. However, soil moisture initialization approaches in coupled models remain quite diverse in terms of their complexity and observational roots, while assessment using bulk forecast statistics can be simplistic and misleading. In this study, a suite of soil moisture initialization approaches is used to generate short-term coupled forecasts over the U.S. Southern Great Plains using NASA's Land Information System (LIS) and NASA Unified WRF (NU-WRF) modeling systems. This includes a wide range of currently used initialization approaches, including soil moisture derived from ``off the shelf'' products such as atmospheric models and land data assimilation systems, high-resolution land surface model spinups, and satellite-based soil moisture products from SMAP. Results indicate that the spread across initialization approaches can be quite large in terms of soil moisture conditions and spatial resolution, and that SMAP performs well in terms of heterogeneity and temporal dynamics when compared against high-resolution land surface model and in situ soil moisture estimates. Case studies are analyzed using the local land\textendash atmosphere coupling (LoCo) framework that relies on integrated assessment of soil moisture, surface flux, boundary layer, and ambient weather, with results highlighting the critical role of inherent model background biases. In addition, simultaneous assessment of land versus atmospheric initial conditions in an integrated, process-level fashion can help address the question of whether improvements in traditional NWP verification statistics are achieved for the right reasons.},

The KENDA system comprises a local ensemble transform Kalman filter (LETKF) and a deterministic analysis based on the Kalman gain for the analysis ensemble mean. The KENDA software suite includes tools for adaptive localization, multiplicative covariance inflation, relaxation to prior perturbations and adaptive observation errors. In the version introduced here, conventional data (radiosonde, aircraft, wind profiler, surface station data) are assimilated. Latent heat nudging of radar precipitation has also been added to the KENDA system to be applied to the deterministic analysis only or additionally to all ensemble members. The performance of different system components is investigated in a quasi-operational setting using a basic cycling environment (BACY) for a period of six days with 24 h forecasts. For this period and an additional 28 day period, deterministic KENDA forecasts are compared with forecasts based on the observation nudging data assimilation scheme, which is currently operational at the German Weather Service (Deutscher Wetterdienst, DWD). For our experiments, lateral boundary conditions for the regional model are given by a global ensemble Kalman filter for the ICOsahedral Nonhydrostatic (ICON) model. The performance of the KENDA system proves overall to be superior to the forecast quality of the operational nudging scheme, in particular with regard to precipitation. Latent heat nudging improves precipitation forecasts in both systems and has slightly more benefit in combination with the LETKF than with observation nudging.},

  abstract = {This study focuses on testing two different soil moisture analysis systems based on screen-level parameters (2-m temperature T2m, 2-m relative humidity RH2m) and 1.4-GHz passive microwave brightness temperatures TB. First, a simplified extended Kalman filter (EKF) system is compared with an optimal interpolation (OI) method assimilating screen-level parameters in a single-column version of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) numerical weather prediction model. In the second part of this study, the EKF is applied to investigate whether the synergy of T2m, RH2m, and additionally TB in an assimilation framework improves the simulated soil moisture and atmospheric parameters. For a summer period (130 days) during the First International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project (ISLSCP) Field Experiment (FIFE) 1987 it is shown that the OI and EKF analysis systems give similar results. Both systems distinguish consistently between periods of atmospheric and surface-controlled fluxes. Though the overall soil water is adjusted by the same amount, the EKF system simulates increments increasing from the first to the third layer, whereas in the OI method they are equally distributed. The EKF system is applied for the Southern Great Plains Field Experiment 1997 (SGP97) testing the assimilation of a synergy of T2m, RH2m, and TB. The observed root zone soil moisture is best simulated by the control run and when TB is assimilated. The assimilation of T2m and RH2m worsens the simulated root zone soil moisture compared to observations, because during a 10-day period modeled T2m and RH2m considerably diverge from observations and soil moisture is tuned to compensate for deficiencies in the model. But in comparison to observed net radiation, heat fluxes, and near-surface soil moisture, it is shown that the assimilation of the synergy of observation types (T2m, RH2m, and TB) gives more consistent results than when they are assimilated separately.},

Since 2001, the sequential assimilation of surface variables is used to generate the initial conditions to launch the Global Environmental Multiscale (GEM) coupled forecast model. The work presented here is to replace the sequential DA with an independent surface DA system, the Canadian Land Data Assimilation System (CaLDAS) assimilating screen-level observations, and to compare assimilation experiments with CaLDAS run in uncoupled and weakly coupled modes. In the uncoupled mode, CaLDAS is used to initialize the forecast without interacting with the 4D-EnVar system. In the coupled mode, the analyses generated from CaLDAS and 4D-EnVar are used to initialize the forecast model. The analyses and forecasts from uncoupled and coupled runs are evaluated against surface and radiosonde observations over different subdomains to conclude the impact of coupling CaLDAS with 4D-EnVar. Results indicate a statistically significant reduction in bias and standard deviation at the surface for screen-level temperature and dewpoint temperature on the order of 0.1 K, and in the lower troposphere between 1000 and 500 hPa on the order of 0.1 dam for geopotential height and 0.1 K for air temperature and dewpoint depression in the coupled DA runs. The positive impact persists up to 5 days over some subdomains. It is concluded that the coupled DA approach generally performs better than the uncoupled version.},

The modeling platform consists of an atmospheric model (Consortium for Small-Scale Modeling; COSMO), a land surface model (the NCAR Community Land Model, version 3.5; CLM3.5), and a 3D variably saturated groundwater flow model (ParFlow). An external coupler (Ocean Atmosphere Sea Ice Soil, version 3.0; OASIS3) with multiple executable approaches is employed to couple the three independently developed component models, which intrinsically allows for a separation of temporal\textendash spatial modeling scales and the coupling frequencies between the component models.Idealized TerrSysMP simulations are presented, which focus on the interaction of key hydrologic processes, like runoff production (excess rainfall and saturation) at different hydrological modeling scales and the drawdown of the water table through groundwater pumping, with processes in the atmospheric boundary layer. The results show a strong linkage between integrated surface\textendash groundwater dynamics, biogeophysical processes, and boundary layer evolution. The use of the mosaic approach for the hydrological component model (to resolve subgrid-scale topography) impacts simulated runoff production, soil moisture redistribution, and boundary layer evolution, which demonstrates the importance of hydrological modeling scales and thus the advantages of the coupling approach used in this study.Real data simulations were carried out with TerrSysMP over the Rur catchment in Germany. The inclusion of the integrated surface\textendash groundwater flow model results in systematic patterns in the root zone soil moisture, which influence exchange flux distributions and the ensuing atmospheric boundary layer development. In a first comparison to observations, the 3D model compared to the 1D model shows slightly improved predictions of surface fluxes and a strong sensitivity to the initial soil moisture content.},

This method is compared to weakly coupled DA in which the coupled model is used for the background, but the cross-domain error covariance is not utilized.

Strongly coupled DA reduces the ocean analysis errors compared to weakly coupled DA, and the higher accuracy of the ocean also improves the atmosphere.

For the cold-semiarid Naqu area, both ECMWF soil moisture analyses significantly overestimate the regional soil moisture in the monsoon seasons. For the cold-humid Maqu network area, the ECMWF products have comparable accuracy as reported by previous studies in the humid monsoon period. The comparisons were made among the liquid soil moisture analysis from ECMWF, the ground station's measurements and the satellite estimates from the Advanced Scatterometer sensor. The results show reasonable performances of the ECMWF soil moisture analyses (i.e., both optimum interpolation and extended Kalman filter products) and the Advanced Scatterometer level 2 products, when compared to the in situ measurements.},

Studying the coupling between soil moisture and air temperature is of vital importance for forecasting climate change. This study evaluates this coupling over China from 1980\&ndash;2013 by using an energy-based diagnostic method, which represents the momentum, heat, and water conservation equations in the atmosphere, while the contributions of soil moisture are treated as external forcing. The results showed that the soil moisture\&ndash;temperature coupling is strongest in the transitional climate zones between wet and dry climates, which here includes Northeast China and part of the Tibetan Plateau from a viewpoint of annual average. Furthermore, the soil moisture\&ndash;temperature coupling was found to be stronger in spring than in the other seasons over China, and over different typical climatic zones, it also varied greatly in different seasons. We conducted two case studies (the heatwaves of 2013 in Southeast China and 2009 in North China) to understand the impact of soil moisture\&ndash;temperature coupling during heatwaves. The results indicated that over areas with soil moisture deficit and temperature anomalies, the coupling strength intensified. This suggests that soil moisture deficits could lead to enhanced heat anomalies, and thus, result in enhanced soil moisture coupling with temperature. This demonstrates the importance of soil moisture and the need to thoroughly study it and its role within the land\&ndash;atmosphere interaction and the climate on the whole.},

Two 15-yr simulations of CCM3 coupled with CLM and the NCAR Land Surface Model (LSM), respectively, are used to document the relative impact of CLM versus LSM on land surface climate. It is found that CLM significantly reduces the summer cold bias of surface air temperature in LSM, which is associated with higher sensible heat fluxes and lower latent heat fluxes in CLM, and the winter warm bias over seasonally snow-covered regions, especially in Eurasia. CLM also significantly improves the simulation of the annual cycle of runoff in LSM. In addition, CLM simulates the snow mass better than LSM during the snow accumulation stage. These improvements are primarily caused by the improved parameterizations in runoff, snow, and other processes (e.g., turbulence) in CLM. The new land boundary data (e.g., leaf-area index, fractional vegetation cover, albedo) also contribute to the improvement in surface air temperature simulation over some regions. Overall, CLM has little impact on precipitation and surface net radiative fluxes.},
